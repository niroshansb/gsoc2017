## Installation and function of istSOS

istSOS has been installed in the server by following the [tutorial.](http://istsos.org/en/latest/doc/installation.html) After the installation you can try to load the istSOS by using your browser. In my case I couldn't open the istSOS. Then I have followed the step 7 which is mentioned in the [tutorial.](http://istsos.org/en/latest/doc/installation.html). 

For the testing I have used [Arduino UNO Rev. 3](http://www.arduino.org/products/boards/arduino-uno) with [DHT11 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/386).

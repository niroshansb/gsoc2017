"Integrating istSOS as a data store in MapMint"

The idea of integrating istSOS as a data store in MapMint is able to provide a platform for data visualization which can be used as near real time, analysis such as interpolation analysis, conversion such as vector and raster data, and publish as maps and OGS standard services such as WMS, WFS,WMTS and WPS by utilizing the data from istSOS. The provided datasets and services (WMTS,WMS, etc) can be deploy within MapMint or for any other software such as GRASS GIS to enable new processing capabilities.
